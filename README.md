# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
challenges for 2021 and 2022.

They are all in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) and use a mixture of
approaches. Generally, I prefer to use immutable data structures and a
functional programming style, but you'll also find some OO, pure
procedural and mutable data in use too. Sometimes, that's just the simplest
way to solve the problem. And simple and understandable trumps "clever".
Having said that, some of the code might well be be over-complex for what
it's trying to do ...

There are usually some tests for each day's solution, although the final
arbiter of success is submission to the AoC site itself. I haven't included
my input files as you can get your own set from the site.
